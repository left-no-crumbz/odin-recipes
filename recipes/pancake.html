        <li>2 tablespoons white vinegar</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>

        <li>Combine milk and vinegar in a medium bowl and set aside for 5 minutes to make sour milk.</li>
        <li>Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large mixing bowl. Whisk egg and butter into soured milk. Pour flour mixture into milk mixture and whisk until lumps are gone.</li>
