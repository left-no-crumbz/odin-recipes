    </pre>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk eggs with salt until completely combined and very foamy.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a skillet over low heat until bubbling. Add whisked eggs; cook, stirring frequently for even, moist curds, until thickened and creamy, but still shiny, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove scrambled eggs from the pan before they begin to look dry, as they will continue to thicken off the heat.</li>
    </ol>
