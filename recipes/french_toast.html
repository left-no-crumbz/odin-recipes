    <h3>Description</h3>
    <pre>
        The secret ingredient in this fluffy French toast recipe: all-purpose flour! 
        Flour binds the liquids together, which creates a more traditional “batter” and helps prevent soggy results. 
        This extra ingredient ensures the French toast is crispy on the outside, but soft and fluffy on the inside.
